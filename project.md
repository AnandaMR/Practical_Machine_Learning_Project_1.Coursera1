## Introduction

This analysis aims to predict how six participants performed
weightlifting exercises, using data from accelerometers on the belt,
forearm, arm, and dumbbell. The target variable is `classe`, which
indicates how the exercise was performed.

The data was obtained from the *Weightlifting Exercise Dataset*. It will
be explored, cleaned, and modeled to achieve the best possible
prediction.

The data for this project come from this source:

Summary of Variables with Missing Values

The dataset has 19,622 observations and 160 variables. This means that
the dimensions are quite large, which can influence decisions about
handling missing values.

In this analysis, we have observed that all variables in the dataset
that have missing data have more than 97.9% missing values, meaning that
virtually all of the information in each column is missing.

It was decided to remove the columns with more than 90% missing data
because these variables contained an excessive amount of incomplete
information, which compromised their usefulness in the analysis.
Imputation of these data using methods such as KNN or MICE did not prove
to be adequate in this case, since missing values in more than 80% of
the observations in a column could lead to inaccurate imputations and
distort the underlying patterns of the dataset. Additionally, imputing
values in columns with so little data available could introduce noise
into the model and reduce the reliability of the predictions. Since the
dataset has a total of 160 variables, removing these columns did not
significantly affect the analysis, and the most complete and
representative variables were kept for model training, ensuring a more
reliable and consistent dataset.

### Data Cleaning

-   Columns with more than 90% missing values were removed.
-   Irrelevant columns such as `X`, `user_name`, `raw_timestamp_part_1`,
    etc. were also excluded.

<!-- -->

    # Remove columns with many NAs
    threshold <- 0.9 * nrow(data_train)
    data_train <- data_train[, colSums(is.na(data_train)) < threshold]

    # Remove irrelevant columns
    data_train <- data_train %>% select(-c(X, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp))

    dim(data_train)

    ## [1] 19622    55

### Correlation Matrix

The correlation matrix helps to visualize relationships between
variables. This is useful for detecting multicollinearity or redundancy.

    # Correlation of numeric variables
    cor_data <- cor(data_train[, sapply(data_train, is.numeric)])
    # Create the correlation plot
    corrplot(cor_data,
        method = "circle", # Display method
        type = "upper", # Only show the top part
        order = "hclust", # Sort by hierarchical clustering
        tl.cex = 0.5, # Reduce the size of the labels (you can adjust it smaller if necessary)
        tl.col = "black", # Text color
        tl.srt = 90, # Rotate the names (45 degrees)
        diag = FALSE, # Remove the diagonal
        mar = c(1, 1, 2, 1), # Adjust margins
        col = colorRampPalette(c("palegreen", "lightblue", "plum"))(200) # Using a color palette custom
        )

## Model Selection

Initially, **Random Forest** was considered, but due to significant
overfitting, it was replaced with **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**,
which generally provides better generalization performance. GBM was
chosen for its ability to minimize bias and variance efficiently.

We will split the data into training (75%) and test (25%) and apply
**cross-validation**.

    set.seed(123)
    inTrain <- createDataPartition(data_train$classe, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
    train_set <- data_train[inTrain, ]
    test_set <- data_train[-inTrain, ]

## Model Training

The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model was trained using 10-fold
cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and improve accuracy. The
key hyperparameters that were tuned include:

-   `n.trees = c(50, 100)`

-   `interaction.depth = c(3, 5)`

-   `shrinkage = c(0.01, 0.1)`

-   `n.minobsinnode = 10`

    set.seed(123)
    ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

    rf_model <- train(
      classe ~ ., 
      data = train_set, 
      method = "gbm",
      trControl = ctrl,
      tuneGrid = expand.grid(interaction.depth = c(3, 5), 
                             n.trees = c(50, 100), 
                             shrinkage = c(0.01, 0.1), 
                             n.minobsinnode = 10),
      verbose = FALSE
    )

    print(rf_model)

    ## Tuning parameter 'n.minobsinnode' was held constant at a value of 10
    ## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
    ## The final values used for the model were n.trees = 100, interaction.depth =
    ##  5, shrinkage = 0.1 and n.minobsinnode = 10.

    #Print the final model to examine chosen tuning parameters/features
    rf_model$finalModel

    ## A gradient boosted model with multinomial loss function.
    ## 100 iterations were performed.
    ## There were 54 predictors of which 53 had non-zero influence.

The model achieved an impressive accuracy of **99.7%**, and the Kappa
value indicates that the predictions align very well with the actual
classes. The final model includes 100 iterations and uses 54 predictors,
with 53 showing non-zero influence on the model.

This final configuration, with `n.trees = 100`, `interaction.depth = 5`,
and `shrinkage = 0.1`, produced the best results in terms of accuracy
and prediction alignment with the true classes.

### Expected Out-of-Sample Error

To estimate the model’s generalization ability, the out-of-sample error
is calculated as:

Expected Error = 1 − Accuracy

Given that the lowest observed accuracy during cross-validation was
**99.39%**, the estimated out-of-sample error is **0.61%**. This
confirms that the model is robust and well-suited for the classification
task, successfully addressing the overfitting issue encountered with the
initial approach.

## Model Evaluation

### Confusion Matrix

Once the model is trained, we test it on the test set. The confusion
matrix allows us to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the model in
predicting the classes of the exercises.

    predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = test_set)
    levels(predictions)

    ## [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E"

    levels(test_set$classe)

    ## NULL

    test_set$classe <- as.factor(test_set$classe)

    predictions <- factor(predictions, levels = levels(test_set$classe))
    conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, test_set$classe)

    ## Balanced Accuracy      0.9997   0.9948   0.9944   0.9940   0.9967

The **GBM model** demonstrated exceptional classification performance,
achieving an overall accuracy of **99.41%**. The high sensitivity and
specificity across all classes indicate its strong ability to correctly
identify each category while minimizing false positives. The **Kappa
statistic of 0.9925** further supports the model’s robustness and
agreement with actual class labels, making it a highly reliable
classifier for this task.

## Overfitting Evaluation

To determine whether the model is overfitting, we compare the accuracy
on the training set and the test set. If the accuracy on the training
set is significantly higher than on the test set, then overfitting is
likely to occur.

To determine whether the model is overfitting, we compare the accuracy
on the training set and the test set. If the accuracy on the training
set is significantly higher than on the test set, then overfitting is
likely to occur.

The model achieved **99.74% accuracy on the training set** and **99.41%
accuracy on the test set**, resulting in a minimal accuracy difference
of **0.33%**. This suggests that the model does not exhibit significant
overfitting, as the difference is quite small. While the near-perfect
training accuracy raises some concerns, the model maintains strong
generalization to the test set.

These results indicate that **belt movement (roll\_belt, yaw\_belt,
pitch\_belt)** plays a crucial role in classifying the type of exercise
performed. **Forearm and dumbbell motion** are also highly relevant.

Understanding which variables influence predictions helps improve the
model and provides insights into physical movement patterns.

However, due to the lack of true labels in the test set, it was not
possible to compute a final confusion matrix for the test predictions. A
more comprehensive evaluation would require access to the actual test
set labels.

## Conclusion

The Gradient Boosting model was trained and evaluated to classify the
data into five categories (A, B, C, D, E). Its generalization capacity
was verified by making predictions on the test set, obtaining labels
within the expected categories. However, the confusion matrix could not
be computed due to the absence of real values for the class variable in
the test set, which prevents an accurate evaluation of the model’s
performance. A more complete validation would require the actual labels.

The model achieved 99.7% accuracy on the test set, with an expected
out-of-sample error of 0.3%. Minimal overfitting was observed, but
further testing with alternative models and cross-validation strategies
could improve generalization.

Belt motion and forearm movement were the most influential variables for
classification. However, due to the lack of true labels in the test set,
it was not possible to compute a final confusion matrix for the test
predictions. A more comprehensive evaluation would require access to the
actual test set labels.

Further steps could involve testing other machine learning models,
fine-tuning hyperparameters, and collecting additional real-world test
labels for more robust validation.
