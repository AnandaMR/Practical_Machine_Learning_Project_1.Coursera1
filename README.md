# Weightlifting Performance Prediction with Sensors

## Description
This project aims to analyze and predict performance in weightlifting exercises using sensor data. Through data analysis and machine learning models, the goal is to identify patterns and improve training based on quantifiable data.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains raw and processed data used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks with data exploration and modeling.
- `src/` - Source code for data preprocessing and model training.
- `models/` - Trained models and evaluations.
- `README.md` - Project reference document.

## Usage
To perform analysis and prediction, follow these steps:

1. Download the data into the `data/` folder.
2. Run the notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploratory analysis.
3. Use the scripts in `src/` to preprocess data and train models.
4. Evaluate the models and visualize the results.

## Results
The generated models allow predicting weightlifting performance based on sensor data. The results can be used to optimize training and prevent injuries.
